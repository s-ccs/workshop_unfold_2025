Welcome to the **first official Unfold.jl workshop**! Here you will learn everything to be able to do _your_ first Unfold analysis!
The workshop will be **free** and **fully online**, so you can join from anywhere in the world. 

## What even is Unfold? 🤔
Unfold.jl is a Julia Package for regression and event-based time series analysis, with a focus on regression ERPs for EEG analysis.

If you're not already familiar with Unfold or regression ERP's, we recommend you to read the original publication by [Ehinger & Dimigen](https://peerj.com/articles/7838/).

## Material covered 💪
During the workshop we will cover everything from mass-univariate modeling of EEG data until marginalized effects and overlap correction. For more information please have a look at our (preliminary) schedule [here](program.qmd).
