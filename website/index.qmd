Welcome to the **first official Unfold.jl workshop**! Here you will learn everything to be able to do _your_ first Unfold analysis!
The workshop will be **free** and **fully online**, so you can join from anywhere in the world. 

## What even is Unfold? 🤔
Unfold.jl is a Julia Package for regression and event-based time series analysis, with a focus on regression ERPs for EEG analysis.

If you're not already familiar with **Unfold** or **regression ERP's**, we recommend you to read the original publication by [Ehinger & Dimigen](https://peerj.com/articles/7838/).

## Material covered 💪
During the workshop we will cover everything from **mass-univariate modeling** of EEG data to **marginalized effects** and **overlap correction**. For more information please have a look at our [(preliminary) schedule](program.qmd).
