title: "Installation guide"
---

To actively participate in the workshop and use the notebooks we provided, you will need to install both Julia and Pluto.jl on your system. The following is a minimal guide on how to do this. You can find more extensive information in the [Pluto.jl documentation](https://plutojl.org/en/docs/install/) (which this guide is based on) and also watch their [instruction video](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall24/installation/).

::: {.callout-note}
Please note that we will not be able to help with installing Julia and/or Pluto during the workshop. If you experience problems please contact us *before* the day of the workshop. Best case you explain your issue in our [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/Unfold.jl/discussions/categories/unfold-jl-workshop-2025), here you can also see problems others had (you will need a GitHub account to make contributions).

# Installation
## Step 1: Installing Julia

In most cases, we recommend installing Julia through the julia-version manager `juliaup`. This will allow you in the future to easily update and switch between different Julia versions. 

**Windows:** [Windows app store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJNWW8PVKMN) or run `winget install --name Julia --id 9NJNWW8PVKMN -e -s msstore` in a `cmd.exe`

**MacOS/Linux:** open a terminal and run `curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh`

‚ùå Something didn't work? [Try following the instructions here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). You can also ask questions in our [Unfold.jl github-discussion group](https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/Unfold.jl/discussions/categories/unfold-jl-workshop-2025)


If all things fail, you can also try to go to [https://julialang.org/downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads) and install the latest stable release.


## Step 2: Run Julia

Make sure that you can run Julia. To do this, open a terminal and type `julia`. You should then see the below startup message and your terminal should say "julia".

## Step 3: Install Pluto

To install Pluto type

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto")
```

into the Julia terminal (i.e. after step 2)

## Step 4: Run Pluto

To run Pluto.jl, simply type the following in the Julia terminal:

```julia
import Pluto; Pluto.run()
```

This will start up a Pluto session and automatically open your browser.

## Step 5: Installing the required packages

We are providing a "package installation" notebook. This will make sure that everyone will be using the same package versions. Please run this one before any of the other notebooks.

1. Copy this link to the installation notebook: 
```julia
https://github.com/s-ccs/workshop_unfold_2025/blob/5a364e71057edddfa39f423f8abc4ebc44d9297e/00_installation.jl
```
2. Put it in the Pluto.jl box next to **open a notebook**.

3. Confirm that you want to start this notebook!

4. Grab a ‚òï - it will take 5-15 minutes to install all packages.

5. And then you are all done and ready for the workshop üéâ
