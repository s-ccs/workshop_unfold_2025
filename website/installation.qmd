title: "Installation guide"
---

To actively partake in the workshop and make use of the notebooks provided by us you will need to install both Julia and Pluto.jl on your system. The following is a minimal guide on how to do this. You can find more extensive information in the [Pluto.jl documentation](https://plutojl.org/en/docs/install/) (of which this guide is base on), and also watch their [instruction video](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall24/installation/).

::: {.callout-note}
Please note that we will not be able to help with installing Julia and/or Pluto during the workshop. If you experience problems please contact us *before* the day of the workshop.

# Step 1: Installing Julia

In most cases, goin to [https://julialang.org/downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads) and installing the current stable release is sufficient.

However, if you plan to use Julia in the future, we recommend installing Julia through a version manager like `juliaup`. This allows you to easily switch between different Julia versions. You can find more information about `juliaup` [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).

# Step 2: Run Julia

Make sure that you can run Julia. To do this, open a termminal and type `julia`. You should then see the below startup message and your terminal should say "julia".

# Step 3: Install Pluto

To install Pluto type

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto")
```

into the Julia terminal (i.e. after step 2)

# Step 4: Run Pluto

To run Pluto.jl, simply type the following in the Julia terminal:

```julia
import Pluto; Pluto.run()
```

This will start up a Pluto session and automatically open your browser.

And then you are all done and ready for the workshop ðŸŽ‰
