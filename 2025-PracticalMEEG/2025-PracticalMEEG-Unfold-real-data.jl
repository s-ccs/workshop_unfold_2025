In case you are wondering why `typeof(eegdata_epochs)` is not only `Float64`, but also contains `Missing`:

When epoching an event, the event-window might overlap with a region of data that does not have any data (e.g. the beginning/end of the recording, or data marked as artefactual). In most EEG libraries, such trials are then removed from further analysis (e.g. eeglab, mne). In `Unfold.jl`, we have (almost) full support to handle missings, that is, also "partial"-trials are used in the average!

This can be especially advantageous in population with lot's of blinks, movements etc. where each cleaned artefact removes a whole trial, like infants.
